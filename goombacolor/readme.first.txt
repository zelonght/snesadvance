1. There is Official site of Goomba @ http://www.webpersona.com/goomba/ and the latest emulater goomba is the version 2.0 dated 2004.
2. There is a newer version which support better color at Dwedit's website https://www.dwedit.org/gba/goombacolor.php dated 2019-05-04. This is better (and newer) in term of color and game detection but it also hit some regression like the game Qix can is not playable. 
3. Hence, you may need to use both 1. and 2. for your different games.
